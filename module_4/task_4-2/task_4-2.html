      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>An array is a collection of elements that can be of the same or different types, stored in a single variable and indexed for easy access.</p>
      
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode"?</li>
      <p>Hardcoding refers to embedding fixed data or values directly into the source code, instead of fetching them dynamically or through input.</p>
      
      <li>How do we traverse an array without knowing its length?</li>
      <p>By using loops, such as a <code>for</code> or <code>forEach</code> loop, which iterates through the array dynamically based on its size.</p>
      
      <li>Why store instances of a class in an array?</li>
      <p>Storing instances of a class in an array helps organize and manage multiple objects, enabling easy manipulation and traversal.</p>
      
      <li>How do "Workdays" and "Weekends" differ in EWeekDays?</li>
      <p>Workdays include weekdays such as Monday through Friday, while Weekends represent Saturday and Sunday. Each has distinct attributes for functionality.</p>
      
      <li>How does a "callback" function work in sorting?</li>
      <p>A callback function is passed to the <code>sort</code> method to define custom sorting logic. It compares two elements and returns a value to determine their order.</p>
      
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines?</li>
      <p>The callback function compares array elements pairwise and rearranges them based on the comparison, either in ascending or descending order.</p>
      
      <li>What is the first element of a two-dimensional array?</li>
      <p>In a 2D array, the first element is typically the first row, which is itself an array containing all the elements of that row.</p>
