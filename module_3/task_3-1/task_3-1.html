      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the wake-up time is less than 7, the system indicates that you can take the bus to school.]</p>
      
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake-up time is not 7 in part 2, more complex actions may be triggered, such as adjusting the schedule or other conditions. When the time is exactly 7, a more detailed process may start, often with multiple steps or additional checks.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[When the wake time is less than 7, the system may activate an early routine or display a message indicating that it’s too early. When the wake time is greater than 8, it might trigger a different response indicating that it’s late, adjust plans, and inform about missed opportunities.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>When the number is exactly 0, the system should specifically check for this condition. Zero is neither positive nor negative by standard mathematical definitions. Therefore, if the variable equals 0, the expected output should indicate that the number is zero. The program should have a clear check for zero to ensure accurate logical processing.</p>
